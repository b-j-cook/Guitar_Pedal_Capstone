Custom Daisy Seed code (.cpp) and effects can be found in DaisyExamples -> MyProjects
    Git bash must be used as the terminal for editing to work.
    Make clean and then make to remake the code. To flash, reset the daisy seed and enter the command
    make program-dfu.

Description of remaining folders:
-Analog Distortion Simulation contains LTSpice files for analog distortion effect simulations.
-MATLAB + Simulink Design contains MATLAB code and figures for the analysis of the implemented digital effects and initial high level system design.
-MATLAB Noise Figures contains images, audio, and a MATLAB file for the noise analysis and implemented solution.
-PCB contains hierarchal KiCad schematics for the full pedal design, as well as the full bill of materials.
